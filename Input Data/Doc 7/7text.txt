From a computational perspective, the unit of text can also make a huge difference, especially when we are using bag-of-words models, where word order within a unit does not matter. Small segments, like tweets, sometimes do not have enough information to make their semantic context clear. In contrast, larger segments, like novels, have too much variation, making it difficult to train focused models. Finding a good segmentation sometimes means combining short documents and subdividing long documents. The word “document” can therefore be misleading. But it is so ingrained in the common NLP lexicon that we use it anyway in this article.
