Yet, on the other hand, this would be an oversimplification of our results. We show that when emotional arcs are combined with different genres and produced in different budget categories any of the 6 emotional arcs may produce financially successful films. Therefore, a careful selection of the script-budget-genre combination will lead to financial success. It is obvious, however, that data science can significantly advance the dialog between motion picture production companies and the viewers and help generate “on demand”, customer-centric, and even personalized content which consumers of motion pictures would be interested in purchasing.
