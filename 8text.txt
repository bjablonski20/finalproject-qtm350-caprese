In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me to help lead this country alongside Barack Obama. Today, I’m asking for your trust once again — this time, in Kamala and me. We can heal the soul of this nation — I promise we won’t let you down.
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will work with Democrats and Republicans, and I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do. Because that’s the job of a president.
As president, I will: – Rebuild our infrastructure – Combat climate change – Create millions of good-paying, union jobs
